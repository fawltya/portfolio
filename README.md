# Seamus's Portfolio

## Description

This is my front-end developer portfolio, designed to introduce myself to potential clients, show them my previous work, and give information on how they can get in touch with me.

Through creating this site I developed my skills with responsive web design. I also improved my semantic html and accessibility knowledge, part of which was adding 'title' tags to links and an 'external-link' icon to external links.

## Installation

To view the website visit [fawltya.github.io/portfolio](https://fawltya.github.io/portfolio)
